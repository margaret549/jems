<p>Emily Beisel of Weatherford, Oklahoma, made the short two-hour drive to Shawnee, Oklahoma, for the 2024 Bonus Race World Finals (BRWF). The Bonus Race World Finals, taking place June 10-16, adds more than $90,000 to barrel racing and rope racing payouts. Racers must earn a “qualifier” from a qualifying event/series to participate in the $40,000 bonus race and the final $5,000 bonus in the BRWF. Entry to this event is rider-based, with the only limitation placed on horse entry: the maximum is two times.</p>
<p>Beisel earned eight qualifying spots before the BRWF. On Tuesday, June 11, Emily won the Bonus Race aboard the Namgis D 33, better known to barrel racing fans as &#8220;Chogo.&#8221; This veteran team recorded a run of 13.83 seconds. The race also finished second overall in the combined bonus race and won the ultimate prize.</p>
<p>Beisel&#8217;s entire team of horses contributed to her big victory in the event. Ivory on Fire &#8220;Liza&#8221; placed fifth overall and third in the finals. Teasin&#8217; Dat Guy “Chewy” finished third on Wednesday and seventh overall. Namgis D 35 &#8220;Pipewrench&#8221; placed 16th overall and 10th in the final. Fresh off his first position and victory in a professional rodeo, Vanilla Gorilla &#8220;Trigger&#8221; even snuck into 2D to contribute to the team total.</p>
<p>Chongo did the heavy lifting on Biesel&#8217;s team. The 14-year-old gelding added another $20,349 to his lifetime earnings. Chongo&#8217;s BWRF earnings put the gelding dangerously close to $850,000 in career earnings. Biesel&#8217;s earnings in this event totaled $41,650, with each horse contributing to the overall total.</p>
<p>Emily&#8217;s top mount for the 2023 NFR, Liza, earned $13,267. Chewy, owned by 4M Equine, a new addition to Emily&#8217;s arsenal, earned $6,296. This 8-year-old mare, trained by Molly Otto, recently helped Emily earn money in North Platte, Nebraska; Parker, Texas; Crossett, Arkansas; Claremore, Oklahoma; and Abbeyville, Kansas, in favor of rodeos. Pipe wrench, who has been part of Biesel&#8217;s team for nearly a decade, won $1,175 and local Trigger won $563.</p>
<p>Two days of earnings at the BWRF look even more attractive considering Beisel&#8217;s 2023-2024 WPRA season earnings of $49,294. Beisel occupies ninth place in the world rankings and, after his performance in the BWRF; She and her horses will be a force to be reckoned with come summer.</p>

In keeping with the NFR&#8217;s ten-round tradition, an additional make-up round was added on the morning of Wednesday, December 13 at 10 a.m m. There will be no public access to this round.</p>
<p>Due to the tragic events that occurred on the UNLV campus on Wednesday, December 6, the original start date has been canceled. The Wrangler NFR will now run through Saturday, December 16 with the full ten rounds scheduled to determine the PRCA world champions. The original purse of $11.5 million will remain in effect and will be paid in full over the nine days of competition and ten rounds.</p>

<p>A moment of silence will be observed on Friday, December 8 at the start of the rodeo show.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are all heartbroken by the tragic events that occurred Wednesday,&#8221; said LVE President Tim Keener. “The National Finals Rodeo has united the Las Vegas community since 1985, and we will honor those we have lost through our rodeo, an event that celebrates unity, togetherness, and the coming together of friends and families. “We will do this in solidarity with our fans, as well as our partners at the PRCA, UNLV, and the community.”</p>
<p>&#8220;The PRCA is saddened by the tragedy that occurred yesterday and our thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their friends and family,&#8221; said PRCA CEO Tom Glause. “We have worked closely with our partners in Las Vegas and the Thomas &amp; Mack Center to work on the NFR schedule while maintaining sensitivity to the events that took place. “We will bring our fans together on Friday night to share our support for this community.”</p>
<p>The Cowboy Channel Cowboy Christmas at the Las Vegas Convention Center, in the south and center halls, began today and will continue through Saturday, December 16. It is free and open to the public.</p>

Sandoval and Carlos Mann (Río Bío-Bío Association) and the participation of three colleras with female members in the fourth animal. One of them even took second place, that of Felipe Fuentes and Monserrat Fuentes (Asociación Linares).</p>
<p>The title for Sandoval and Mann, riding Trumaos Negros Suspiro and memorias de Pilauco Come y Calla with 28 good points, was a reward for their consistency in the championship that 21 colleras competed for.<br />
The students of the German Lyceum of the Divine Word of Los Angeles started with 7, they repeated the number in the second bull to take the lead and from there they did not let go; They added 8 in the third and closed their task with 6 to be at the top of the score.</p>
<p>The thing about Fuentes y Fuentes in Quinta San Antonio Bramío and Rarimávida Holgazán was also very meritorious, since they started with 9 good ones, then they put 4, 7 and 4 again to total 24 points, which at the time had them in expectation, but the consecration of those from Río Bío left them in a spectacular second place.<br />
Third were José Manuel Cortés and Adolfo Navarro (Santiago Sur and Talca Oriente Associations) in Doña Ventura Don Gaifa and El Tani Conserje with 23 good points. This couple came with options until the end, entering the fourth bull with 21 points, after scoring 5+8+8, but in the last race they could only do 2 more and with that they closed the champions’ ride.</p>
<p>Another collar that shone until the fourth animal was that of Florencia Figueroa and Luis Bernardo Allendes (Asociación Maipo) in Coyahuasi Preferido and El Vaticano Odre, who scored 21 good points (9+1+8+3), finishing in fourth place.</p>
<p>The fourth bull was also run by Mauricio Vásquez and Alejandro Varela (Asociación Cordillera) in Tanilvoro Castañuela and Las Patagüitas de Pirque Pincel with 17 (5+1+4+7); Vicente Rojas and Luis Felipe Rojas (Talca Association) in Ramal del Claro Buen Compadre and Millalonco Enamorao with 16 (8+2+8-2); and Paulette Ayala and Joaquín Rojas (Maipo and Santiago Poniente Associations) in Royal Tierra Tembleca and Vista Volcán Sorbo Largo with 11 (7+2+1+1), the third couple with a female rider and who, in addition, stood out for being from Basic education.</p>
<p>Before riding the champion, the award was given to the Best Presented Rider, which, like last year, went to Alonso Quiroga and José Pedro Pino (Valle Santa Cruz Association), while the Youngest Rider of the championship was Francisco Muñoz Carvajal.</p>
<p>The Breed Seal, chosen by Rolando Varela, president of the Cordillera Association, and Juan Carlos Moraga, was the mare Las Toscas Prometida, ridden by Roberto Hot</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Activist Eliana Albasetti said that if a practice is “traditional, it does not mean that it should not be changed.” Meanwhile, lawyer María Celeste Jiménez warned that it is not good to validate activities that are a social and human setback.</strong></p>
<p>75% of Chileans stated that they do not feel identified with the rodeo as a typical activity in the country, according to the latest survey carried out by Criteria. Even so, in the Commission on Principles, Civil and Political Rights of the Constitutional Council,  representatives of the Republican Party and Chile Vamos promoted an article  that defines that “the national dance is the cueca and the national sport is the Chilean rodeo.”</p>
<p>In conversation with Radio and Diario Universidad de Chile, the animal rights lawyer and president of Anima Naturalis (Chile), María Celeste Jiménez , pointed out that what is intended with the eventual consecration of rodeo as a national <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231203075657/https://sportsdimond.com/">sports</a> in the new Constitution is to obtain more economic resources. for this practice, along with penalizing any public opposition to it .</p>
<p>“When you declare an activity as national and as something that has to do with the honor of the country, you elevate it to a category in the Constitution in which whoever opposes that is offending the country,” he explained.</p>
<p>In 2009, the Law on Responsible Ownership of Pets and Companion Animals (Cholito Law) was enacted, which does not distinguish between animals. However, the lawyer explained that if the Constitution “cuts off the possibility that there is crime in the rodeo, because it is a national emblem and would be separated from that possibility , you are clearly allowing anything to happen in the rodeo .”</p>
<p>Those who promote this activity defend that “the rodeo has evolved in its relationship with animals, being governed by a Manual of animal welfare and embouchures that regulates the treatment and care of horses and cattle both inside and outside the medialuna,” as explained to At the beginning of July, the director-treasurer of the  Chilean Rodeo Federation, Claudio Aravena Flores, before the Agriculture Commission of the Chamber of Deputies, in the midst of dialogue on a bill that seeks to declare rodeo as a national sport.</p>
<p>Likewise, he assured that rodeo is not just any sport, but one that “promotes Chilean culture and national identity.”</p>
<p>In this regard, the founder of the NGO Animal Libre, Mauricio Serrano , stated that the organization believes in promoting Chileanness, but through activities that do not harm others . “In any activity, in which there is a clear and consensual position, when we move on to lead the other, this must already be questioned. There are limits,” he asserted.</p>
<p>In that sense, he commented that “when we promote folklore through music, dance, food and hundreds of other forms of folk and traditional artistic expression” there is no harm to others, nor is there any mistreatment involved. Therefore, he indicated that these cultural activities are those that as a society we must encourage “over others, such as in this case the rodeo, which we must already eliminate.”</p>
<p>In the same way, the animal rights activist and co-founder of the Empathy Sanctuary, Eliana Albasetti , recognized that the rodeo is a traditional activity, but said that if any practice is “traditional, that does not mean that it should not be changed, even more so. when that tradition ends up to the detriment of someone . ”</p>
<p>“And for someone to be considered someone, they just have to have the particularity of feeling, they don’t have to be your own species,” he highlighted.</p>
<h3>Why rodeo should not be the Chilean national sport?: A door that is beginning to open</h3>
<p>The criminal defender specializing in animal law, María Celeste Jiménez, considers that it is dangerous for rodeo to be a national sport because it means that from that point on the State “will provide resources for the execution of this animal abuse.”</p>
<p>“Be careful, this is a door that is beginning to open, because the best friends of the rodeo huasos are the lords of greyhound racing , they are the lords of coleus, they are the lords of other forms of animal abuse,” he stated.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Jiménez explained that from criminal policy, “which is the science that studies why crimes are created, how to prevent them, why people become bad, why we penalize behavior or not, from green criminology and the FBI (United States Federal Bureau of Investigation), it has been considered that abuse and cruelty to animals is a hard fact when considering that the great abusers of human beings are also born from this .</p>
<p>“So, if we allow them to be given carte blanche to exhibit in crescents, to exhibit, to give more money so that more crescents and rodeos can be made, we are generating praise, a form of animal abuse that makes us more bad people.” . That is why I see a criminal policy reason behind it when it comes to opposing us,” he argued.</p>
<p>Thus, he considered that “it is not good to open doors through which these ways of validating activities that in general are a social and human setback enter . ”</p>
<p>Likewise, animal defender, Eliana Albasetti, expressed that the evolution of society has allowed the use of animals to become obsolete, and with rodeo as a national sport “we are going against what world civilization would be . ”</p>
<p>For the same reason, Albasetti rejected the claims of rodeo defenders that they are the ones who love the animals the most. “They love them because they take them as a resource, as something that makes them money, they don’t want them to protect them. “Animals do not live nor are they cared for in order to give them peace, to make them happy,” she reproached.</p>
<p>The activist highlighted that those who practice this “so-called sport” love and care for animals “because they then sell their bodies, their leather, their skins, use them and abuse them to generate fun. That’s not wanting . “</p>
