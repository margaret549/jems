<p>The National Finals Rodeo will remain in Las Vegas until 2035, thanks to a new contract announced Monday.</p>
<p>The NFR often called the “Super Bowl of Rodeo,” has been in the valley since 1985, except in 2020, when COVID-19 restrictions temporarily moved the event to Arlington, Texas.</p>
<p>During the term of the new contract, the total payment to contestants and stock contractors will be $264,323,473.</p>
<p>The prize money for this year&#8217;s Dec. 5-14 event will be more than $16.2 million and will be $17.5 million next year. The amount will then increase by $1 million each year for the life of the new contract. Upon completion of the contract in 2035, the total payment to contestants and stock contractors will be more than $27.5 million.</p>
<p>Las Vegas Events and the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association will contribute an additional $1.3 million this year and in 2025 as a signing bonus.</p>
<p>Additional elements of the agreement include a season-long marketing program and an official designation as an official sponsor of the PRCA, National Finals Steer Roping, NFR Open and sponsorships for all 12 National Circuit Finals Rodeos.</p>
<p>&#8220;Las Vegas is the sports and entertainment capital of the world and a great home for the National Finals Rodeo,&#8221; said PRCA CEO Tom Glause. “This is a historic agreement for the PRCA that benefits all PRCA members: contestants, stock contractors, committees and contract staff. “This agreement will move forward and help the sport continue to grow and provide security for the future.”</p>
<p>Bill McBeath, president of the Las Vegas Events Board of Directors, was also enthusiastic about the new agreement.</p>
<p>“After working with the PRCA and its representatives for nearly two years, I am pleased with our efforts to ensure Las Vegas is home to the richest and most prestigious rodeo in the world through 2035,” McBeath said. “For nearly 40 years, Las Vegas has built a strong partnership with the PRCA and its stock contestants and contractors. “We believe the new agreement is beneficial to all parties and clearly demonstrates the commitment Las Vegas has to the NFR and the sport of rodeo.”</p>
<p>Tim Keener, president of Las Vegas Events, added: “I would like to recognize the tremendous dedication that Bill McBeath, Michael Gaughan, Tom Glause, and the PRCA have demonstrated over the past 20 months to secure the NFR extension. Our goal is to continue making the NFR a December tradition in our city. “We look forward to working with our partners to grow the NFR experience for rodeo fans in Las Vegas.”</p>
<p>In 2024, the NFR will take place December 5-14 at the Thomas and Mack Center.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first night of rodeo action was canceled as the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo (NFR) held its thoughts on Wednesday&#8217;s shooting at UNLV.</p>
<p>NFR was scheduled to begin Thursday night at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center on the UNLV campus.</p>
<p>&#8220;All of us are saddened by the events that occurred today,&#8221; said Las Vegas Events President Tim Keener. “Our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected. “We thank all first responders, police, security, and the UNLV community for their actions today.”</p>
<p>The decision was announced in a joint statement from the Las Vegas Events Board of Directors and the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association Board of Directors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today&#8217;s shooting on the UNLV campus was alarming and deeply troubling,&#8221; said PRCA Executive Director Tom Glause. “The PRCA appreciates the quick and professional response of authorities and first responders. “Our thoughts at this time are focused on the victims of this senseless act of violence.”</p>
<p>Additional details are expected Thursday morning.</p>
<p>The Cowboy Channel Cowboy Christmas at the Las Vegas Convention Center, in the south and center halls, will continue as planned, opening Thursday and ending Saturday, December 16. That event is free and open to the public.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ora Taton, a veteran roper, had never competed in the Ron Ross Memorial Steer Roping before.</p>
<p>Her first performance in Liberty Hill, Texas, on May 14 and 15, was very remarkable.</p>
<p>The cowboy from Rapid City, South Dakota won the average with a time of 69.2 seconds over five heads.</p>
<p>Taton took home $9,042 in prize money, including $6,239 for winning the average.</p>
<p>It was one of those completely unexpected offers, added Taton, 52. It was unexpected to travel from South Dakota to Texas and win something like that against the guys she was fighting. She had never been there before, and she had already made some money in rodeos this season, and this is one of the main ones we can go to. My wife and I have decided to visit, and want to stay a few days between this (May 14-15) and the next at Liberty Hill (May 19-21).</p>
<p>Taton rose to fifth place in the world rankings due to her strong financial performance at Liberty Hill. She qualified for the National Steer Roping Finals twice, in 2003 and 2004, and won the average in 2003, finishing sixth in the world rankings.</p>
<p>Taton was ranked 20th in the PRCA | RAM world ranking in 2020.</p>
<p>It’s been a long time since I’ve visited (the NFSR), Taton said. I would like to go back there (the NFSR). However, she rarely traveled long distances. I often tell people that if I don’t have money to travel, I won’t. I can’t play unless I win something. This year has been unusual in that I made some money on independent roping in Andrews, Texas early on and was able to go, and have been making money elsewhere. So this year has been a bit strange because I don’t normally make that much money this early in the year.</p>
<p>At Liberty Hill, Taton was riding Spur, her horse.</p>
<p>I guess he’s about 10 years old and he’s the only horse I have right now, Taton said of the horse, which he rode to victory at the Steer Roping National Circuit Finals in Torrington, Wyoming, in 2020. He was about 5 years old. when I buy it. He needed one and he seemed to be able to make one, so my dad (Ralph) and I started him up, and he turned out to be one that we enjoyed. He is one of those exceptional horses.</p>
<p>Taton isn’t sure he’ll make an effort to make it to the NFSR in 2022, despite his strong position in the world rankings.</p>
<p>Everyone tells you to move on when you make money, but I’ve never done that, Taton said. I seem to keep winning, and everyone tells me to move on, but I’m not going to burn down a team by traveling all over the place and disappearing; I just can’t do it. I go to a few others that I don’t usually go to, like Pecos, Texas, and then there’s the 4th of July race, and there are several other ties closer to home (in Rapid City). But I’m not going to set the road on fire.</p>
<p>I’m going, and I’m going to have a good time and be prepared.</p>

<p class="entry-meta">During his 14-year ProRodeo career, Tanner Aus has qualified for six Wrangler Rodeos National Finals. The bareback cyclist from Granite Falls, Minnesota is on track to book another trip to Las Vegas in 2022.</p>
</header>
<div class="entry-content">
<p>This week, Australia was one of the most active teams in qualifying. In the most recent PRCA | RAM World Standings, climbed from ninth to fifth.</p>
<p>Two rodeo wins at The End of the Trail Western Festival in Ogallala, Neb., and The Daily Record Xtreme Bares and Broncs in Ellensburg, Wash., contributed significantly to the increase. For his 16 seconds of work over the weekend, he was paid $7,442.</p>
<p>I’ve only been going to one or two events a weekend, drawing well and figuring out how to take advantage of my opportunities, the 31-year-old Aus said. It was a great winter and so far it’s been a great spring.</p>
<p>Aus rode Kirsten Vold’s Painted Playgirl Rodeo to a 90-point race at Nebraska, his highest-scoring race of the season. The trip to the Cornhusker Estate, he commented, could not have gone better.</p>
<p>He explained, that he knew he was a fantastic horse and that he would have a decent chance of making some money. It was fantastic. That horse bolted and was electrifying down the front of the slides to the left.</p>
<p>I welcomed the opportunity and then one of my fellow passengers, Ty Breuer, came in second with 88.5 points. As a result, we went down to take care of business. It was a fantastic little meeting.</p>
<p>Any cowboy with NFR hopes will need to be consistent down the stretch. Aus understands that the ups and downs are part of the game.</p>
<p>All you can do is ride the ups and downs, he added. Just take it to the next one and expect to keep fleecing horses along the way. That’s how the rodeo works. Streaks never last, no matter how long or short they are. As a result, you need to persevere, play average, and be as consistent as possible.</p>
<p>The other cowboys who made it to the PRCA Top 15 | RAM world rankings are listed below.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<header class="entry-header">Sage Newman is from Montana, and her home-cooked meal was paid off on May 27 for the Melstone Bronc rider.</header>
<div class="entry-content">
<p>Newman put in two outstanding runs in less than an hour to win the Fallon County Xtreme Broncs title. He shared the title with Lefty Holman at the MSU-Northern PRCA Extreme Bares &amp; Broncs Challenge in April, and this is his second Xtreme Broncs victory of the season.</p>
<p>It was cool, the 24-year-old Newman added. Taking part in these rodeos and bronco battles in the Big Sky area has been great. This win felt fantastic.</p>
<p>With a run of 85.5 points in the long round, Newman reached the final. Initially, he competed against Burch Rodeo’s Lunatic From Hell, the 2018 PRCA Saddle Bronc Riding Horse of the Year. It was his third meeting for him and he emerged victorious with a trip of 91 points.</p>
<p>I’ve paired up with him several times, and I think you could call him my old friend, he added. We hit it off well. I was glad to have him as it was one of the most enjoyable days I’ve ever had with him.</p>
<p>Newman’s outstanding season continues with this win. He now ranks first in the PRCA | RAM World Standings, having earned nearly $120,000 so far this season. He attributed much of his comeback this year to hard work and having the right people on his side.</p>
<p>I think just putting in the effort has been extremely beneficial for me. He used to be a fairly average bronc rider, and he felt like he spent his time riding the spur board whenever he could.</p>
<p>Then you understand how important fellow riders are to this activity. That’s what can make or break a man’s career. Kolby Wanchuk, Chase Brooks, and Tanner Butner make a fantastic traveling group for me. They are all fantastic cyclists with great attitudes. That’s exactly what you’re looking for.</p>
<p>With just four months remaining in the regular season, Newman is on the verge of securing back-to-back appearances at the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo. While that is on his mind, he stated that he only cares about having fun and doing his job every night.</p>
<p>Newman added: I feel wonderful and I’m as healthy as I can be. I’m just going to have a good time doing my job and sticking to the fundamentals. It’s not a difficult task. All you have to do now is put your feet up, pick up the reins, and as I said earlier, have fun out there.</p>
<p>Wade Sundell, a veteran saddle bronc rider, was second with an 87.5-point performance, while Brooks and Kade Bruno tied for third with 85 points.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jesse Brown is hitting his stride at the perfect time. The steer fighter from Baker City, Oregon knows how to get to the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo, and he’s going to try again this year.</p>
<p>Brown was a man on a mission at the Elks Rodeo in Santa Maria, California. To win both rounds, he made a pair of runs of 4.5 and 4.6 seconds. In two heads, his time of 9.1 seconds was good enough to win the average title. He attributes his success in California to the horse he rode.</p>
<p>I got to ride Sterling Lambert’s horse, Buzz, and I think that’s a big part of why I did so well, the 29-year-old Brown said. He is a wonderful horse in the corner, and he gave me two good looks there, the jockey says.</p>
<p>He earned $3,353 for his win, which moved him to 11th place in the last PRCA | RAM world ranking. Brown believes the early summer momentum is just what the team needs as the season progresses.</p>
<p>It’s a great boost for me, and it comes at a good time as the schedule here is about to fill up, he said. I want to keep climbing and finish as high as possible this year. However, I think I am in an excellent position for the summer.</p>
<p>And he knows exactly what it will take to return to Las Vegas in 2022, a trip he has made in back-to-back seasons.</p>
<p>First and foremost, a high winning percentage will be needed, Brown said. So you have to be on a good horse, ride with good guys on the road, and stay level with a positive mindset.</p>
<p>The other cowboys who made it to the PRCA Top 15 | RAM world rankings are listed below.</p>
