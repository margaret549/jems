Even so, in the Commission on Principles, Civil and Political Rights of the Constitutional Council,\u00a0\u00a0representatives of the Republican Party and Chile Vamos promoted an article\u00a0\u00a0that defines that \u201cthe national dance is the cueca and the national sport is the Chilean rodeo.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In conversation with Radio and Diario Universidad de Chile, the animal rights lawyer and president of Anima Naturalis (Chile), Mar\u00eda Celeste Jim\u00e9nez , pointed out that what is intended with the eventual consecration of rodeo as a national\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20231203075657\/https:\/\/sportsdimond.com\/\">sports<\/a>\u00a0in the new Constitution is to obtain more economic resources. for this practice, along with penalizing any public opposition to it .<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you declare an activity as national and as something that has to do with the honor of the country, you elevate it to a category in the Constitution in which whoever opposes that is offending the country,\u201d he explained.<\/p>\n<p>In 2009, the Law on Responsible Ownership of Pets and Companion Animals (Cholito Law) was enacted, which does not distinguish between animals.\u00a0However, the lawyer explained that\u00a0if the Constitution \u201ccuts off the possibility that there is crime in the rodeo,\u00a0because it is a national emblem and would be separated from that possibility\u00a0, you are clearly allowing anything to happen in the rodeo\u00a0.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Those who promote this activity defend that \u201cthe rodeo has evolved in its relationship with animals, being governed by a Manual of animal welfare and embouchures that regulates the treatment and care of horses and cattle both inside and outside the medialuna,\u201d as explained to At the beginning of July, the director-treasurer of the\u00a0\u00a0Chilean Rodeo Federation, Claudio Aravena Flores,\u00a0before the Agriculture Commission of the Chamber of Deputies, in the midst of dialogue on a bill that seeks to declare rodeo as a national sport.<\/p>\n<p>Likewise, he assured that rodeo is not just any sport, but one that \u201cpromotes Chilean culture and national identity.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In this regard, the founder of\u00a0the NGO Animal Libre, Mauricio Serrano\u00a0, stated that\u00a0the organization believes in promoting Chileanness, but through activities that do not harm others\u00a0.\u00a0\u201cIn any activity, in which there is a clear and consensual position, when we move on to lead the other, this must already be questioned.\u00a0There are limits,\u201d he asserted.<\/p>\n<p>In that sense, he commented that \u201cwhen we promote folklore through music, dance, food and hundreds of other forms of folk and traditional artistic expression\u201d there is no harm to others, nor is there any mistreatment involved.\u00a0Therefore, he indicated that these cultural activities are those that as a society we must encourage \u201cover others, such as in this case the rodeo, which we must already eliminate.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In the same way, the\u00a0animal rights activist and co-founder of the Empathy Sanctuary, Eliana Albasetti\u00a0, recognized that the rodeo is a traditional activity, but said that\u00a0if any practice is \u201ctraditional, that does not mean that it should not be changed, even more so. when that tradition ends up to the detriment of someone\u00a0. \u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAnd for someone to be considered someone, they just have to have the particularity of feeling, they don\u2019t have to be your own species,\u201d he highlighted.<\/p>\n<h3>Why rodeo should not be the Chilean national sport?: A door that is beginning to open<\/h3>\n<p>The criminal defender specializing in animal law, Mar\u00eda Celeste Jim\u00e9nez, considers that\u00a0it is dangerous for rodeo to be a national sport\u00a0because it means that from that point on the State \u201cwill provide resources for the execution of this animal abuse.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBe careful, this is a door that is beginning to open, because\u00a0the best friends of the rodeo huasos are the lords of greyhound racing\u00a0, they are the lords of coleus, they are the lords of other forms of animal abuse,\u201d he stated.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, Jim\u00e9nez explained that from criminal policy, \u201cwhich is the science that studies why crimes are created, how to prevent them, why people become bad, why we penalize behavior or not, from green criminology and the FBI (United States Federal Bureau of Investigation), it has been considered that\u00a0abuse and cruelty to animals is a hard fact when considering that the great abusers of human beings are also born from this\u00a0.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSo, if we allow them to be given carte blanche to exhibit in crescents, to exhibit, to give more money so that more crescents and rodeos can be made, we are generating praise, a form of animal abuse that makes us more bad people.\u201d .\u00a0That is why I see a criminal policy reason behind it when it comes to opposing us,\u201d he argued.<\/p>\n<p>Thus, he considered that\u00a0\u201cit is not good to open doors through which these ways of validating activities that in general are a social and human setback enter\u00a0. \u201d<\/p>\n<p>Likewise, animal defender, Eliana Albasetti, expressed that the evolution of society has allowed the use of animals to become obsolete, and with rodeo as a national sport \u201cwe are going against what world civilization would be\u00a0.\u00a0\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For the same reason, Albasetti rejected the claims of rodeo defenders that they are the ones who love the animals the most.\u00a0\u201cThey love them because they take them as a resource, as something that makes them money, they don\u2019t want them to protect them.\u00a0\u201cAnimals do not live nor are they cared for in order to give them peace, to make them happy,\u201d she reproached.<\/p>\n<p>The activist highlighted that those who practice this \u201cso-called sport\u201d love and care for animals \u201cbecause they then sell their bodies, their leather, their skins, use them and abuse them to generate fun.\u00a0That\u2019s not wanting\u00a0. \u201c<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Activist Eliana Albasetti
