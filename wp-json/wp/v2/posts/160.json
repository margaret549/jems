He shared the title with Lefty Holman at the MSU-Northern PRCA Extreme Bares &amp; Broncs Challenge in April, and this is his second Xtreme Broncs victory of the season.<\/p>\n<p>It was cool, the 24-year-old Newman added. Taking part in these rodeos and bronco battles in the Big Sky area has been great. This win felt fantastic.<\/p>\n<p>With a run of 85.5 points in the long round, Newman reached the final. Initially, he competed against Burch Rodeo\u2019s Lunatic From Hell, the 2018 PRCA Saddle Bronc Riding Horse of the Year. It was his third meeting for him and he emerged victorious with a trip of 91 points.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve paired up with him several times, and I think you could call him my old friend, he added. We hit it off well. I was glad to have him as it was one of the most enjoyable days I\u2019ve ever had with him.<\/p>\n<p>Newman\u2019s outstanding season continues with this win. He now ranks first in the PRCA | RAM World Standings, having earned nearly $120,000 so far this season. He attributed much of his comeback this year to hard work and having the right people on his side.<\/p>\n<p>I think just putting in the effort has been extremely beneficial for me. He used to be a fairly average bronc rider, and he felt like he spent his time riding the spur board whenever he could.<\/p>\n<p>Then you understand how important fellow riders are to this activity. That\u2019s what can make or break a man\u2019s career. Kolby Wanchuk, Chase Brooks, and Tanner Butner make a fantastic traveling group for me. They are all fantastic cyclists with great attitudes. That\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re looking for.<\/p>\n<p>With just four months remaining in the regular season, Newman is on the verge of securing back-to-back appearances at the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo. While that is on his mind, he stated that he only cares about having fun and doing his job every night.<\/p>\n<p>Newman added: I feel wonderful and I\u2019m as healthy as I can be. I\u2019m just going to have a good time doing my job and sticking to the fundamentals. It\u2019s not a difficult task. All you have to do now is put your feet up, pick up the reins, and as I said earlier, have fun out there.<\/p>\n<p>Wade Sundell, a veteran saddle bronc rider, was second with an 87.5-point performance, while Brooks and Kade Bruno tied for third with 85 points.<\/p>\n<p>If you looking for\u00a0<strong>how to watch\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20231203082332\/https:\/\/www.sportdown.com\/\">NFR live stream<\/a><\/strong>, Please check out our complete guide to access the Las Vegas Rodeo <a href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20231203082332\/https:\/\/www.sportdown.com\/\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sage Newman is from Montana, and her home-cooked meal was paid off on May 27 for the Melstone Bronc rider.
