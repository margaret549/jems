The saddle bronc jockeys were divided into six groups of four, with the winner of each group progressing to a six-man sprint.<\/p>\n<p>Despite scoring just 78.5 points at the Four Star Rodeo\u2019s Dakota Star, Cress advanced.<\/p>\n<p>He is a talented young man, but Cress believes that he is still unpredictable. Fortunately, all six of us were riding tough horses, so my score was good enough.<br \/>\nEven better, Cress was given a far superior draw for the short run: Bar T Rodeo\u2019s Hell Boy.<\/p>\n<p>That is one of their most talented horses of his. Cress said, \u201cI actually outclassed him at the 2020 NFR. He did more than just take his case. Cress finished second in Round 7 of the 2020 Wrangler NFR with an 88.5, earning over $21,000.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At the Battle of the Best, Cress was ready to ride Hell Boy again. He is a horse that always offers pleasant rides. Cress said, \u201cI just thought it was a really good opportunity, especially in a six-man short round.\u201d On paper, having a horse like this promises a lot.<\/p>\n<p>However, there is the paper part and then there is the driving part.<\/p>\n<p>I knew all I had to do was the focus and I would have a shot at winning, Cress said, noting that it wasn\u2019t like his journey at NFR in 2020. He had a slightly different journey. He got a bit heavier as the game progressed. However, I was able to finish strong and make everything go well.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, Cress tied his 2020 Hell Boy score with an 88.5-point ride to win and continue his terrific start to the season. Cress is now fourth in the PRCA | RAM world ranking with nearly $60,000 in Wrangler NFR qualifying earnings. He has qualified for five straight NFRs and won three average NFR titles, including the 2021 edition.<\/p>\n<p>As summer approaches, Cress hopes to keep up the pace.<\/p>\n<p>Cress, who is originally from Hillsdale, Wyoming, but now resides in Weatherford, Texas, said, \u201cI\u2019ve had the privilege of bringing in some good horses at rodeos with a lot of good pay.\u201d I only care about the things I can influence, and the rest will take care of itself. So far, this year has been a success. Hopefully, we can keep the ball rolling.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You know you\u2019re having a great run when you can draw a decent badass animal at any regular season rodeo and be like, \u201cOh yeah, I remember.\u201d At the National Finals Rodeo, I rode it.
