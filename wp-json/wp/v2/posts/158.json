The steer fighter from Baker City, Oregon knows how to get to the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo, and he\u2019s going to try again this year.<\/p>\n<p>Brown was a man on a mission at the Elks Rodeo in Santa Maria, California. To win both rounds, he made a pair of runs of 4.5 and 4.6 seconds. In two heads, his time of 9.1 seconds was good enough to win the average title. He attributes his success in California to the horse he rode.<\/p>\n<p>I got to ride Sterling Lambert\u2019s horse, Buzz, and I think that\u2019s a big part of why I did so well, the 29-year-old Brown said. He is a wonderful horse in the corner, and he gave me two good looks there, the jockey says.<\/p>\n<p>He earned $3,353 for his win, which moved him to 11th place in the last PRCA | RAM world ranking. Brown believes the early summer momentum is just what the team needs as the season progresses.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a great boost for me, and it comes at a good time as the schedule here is about to fill up, he said. I want to keep climbing and finish as high as possible this year. However, I think I am in an excellent position for the summer.<\/p>\n<p>And he knows exactly what it will take to return to Las Vegas in 2022, a trip he has made in back-to-back seasons.<\/p>\n<p>First and foremost, a high winning percentage will be needed, Brown said. So you have to be on a good horse, ride with good guys on the road, and stay level with a positive mindset.<\/p>\n<p>The other cowboys who made it to the PRCA Top 15 | RAM world rankings are listed below.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Read more About PRCA Standings Shuffle: Jesse Brown continues his climb in the Top 15.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you looking for<strong> a How to watch an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sportdown.com\/\">NFR live stream<\/a><\/strong>, Please check out our complete guide to access Las Vegas Rodeo.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Jesse Brown is hitting his stride at the perfect time.
