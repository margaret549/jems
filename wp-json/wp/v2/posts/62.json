I never expected it to be as good as it\u2019s been going,\u201d said Hay, 25. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable. I\u2019m drawing really good horses and I\u2019m riding well too.

Even though I didn\u2019t win money, I was happy just to get one ride here. I was relaxed after that. I knew I could take it the way I\u2019ve been doing it all year and to get on a roll, it helps for the confidence.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI haven\u2019t even looked at the standings all week. I don\u2019t like to do that. I just want to keep focusing on my horse that day and stick to my game plan.

Wright initially set the record with $585,850 a year ago.<\/p>\n<p>On Tuesday, Wright clinched his fourth all-around title and added the single-season PRCA earnings record at $722,824 to his resume. Wright initially set that record in 2021 at $686,513.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bareback rider Jess Pope wins another round<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Jess Pope\u2019s success at the Wrangler NFR keeps picking up steam.<\/p>\n<p>Pope had an 89-point ride on Big Stone Rodeo Inc.\u2019s Mayhem to win Round 7. It was his second-round win at the 2022 NFR as he also won Round 3 with an 86.5-point ride on Stace Smith Pro Rodeos\u2019 Mr. Harry.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI had never been on that horse,\u201d Pope said. \u201cThat ride was fun, but it was a bit tough. He has a weird build; a short back and he hits you in the back the whole time. It feels empty when he starts turning back like that, but it worked out and I was pretty happy to have him.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Pope, who won the average at the 2020 and 2021 NFRs, is leading the average with 606 points on seven heads. He\u2019s also leading the PRCA | RAM World Standings with $290,979.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy mindset is I have the best job in the world, and I\u2019m just tickled to be here. Whatever happens, is going to happen and it sure beats the heck out of having to show up to an office every day and I\u2019m thankful to get to ride bucking horses for a living.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At the 2022 NFR, Pope has not had a ride lower than 85 points in the seven rounds.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Veteran bull rider Trevor Kastner snares Round 8 title<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Trevor Kastner is still one of the best bull riders in the world at age 34.<\/p>\n<p>The Roff, Okla., cowboy had a 90.5-point ride on Pete Carr Pro Rodeo\u2019s Midnight Rider.<\/p>\n<p>Kastner was one of only three cowboys to make the eight-second whistle on Wednesday and earned $36,997 for the victory.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a little while since I\u2019ve been back in here, so it feels great,\u201d he said. \u201cHe (Midnight Rider) turned me off this spring at the San Angelo (Xtreme Bulls, April 10). I didn\u2019t remember it, but I think short-term memory may have helped with that. It was nice getting him to ride tonight.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe past few years I\u2019ve made the finals and it\u2019s gone terribly. This year, I think it hinged on Round 1. I was able to knock him down and I was able to keep going with it. I just try to look at it bull-by-bull. I\u2019m just wanting to stay one bull at a time and take it from there.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Kastner is third in the world standings with $229,996. He has earned $106,457 at this year\u2019s NFR.

He also won Round 5 with a 3.9-second time.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey had won a second and a first on that steer, so I knew that I had a good shot to win it tonight, I just had to make sure I did my job,\u201d Erickson said. \u201cI got a great start, in fact so good that I wasn\u2019t sure I got out on the barrier, but I looked back and saw I was good.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Erickson has moved up to third in the world standings with $187,737.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cCrush worked so well tonight,\u201d Erickson said of his horse. \u201cHis best quality is he is so good in the box; anyone can get on him and he just is ready to perform. My wife and I bought him off Facebook a few years ago and just kept working with him and now he just is so good to ride.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI just have to keep running for the round wins and get as much money as I can.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Team ropers Tyler Wade\/Trey Yates win another NFR round<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Tyler Wade\/Trey Yates is making some noise at the 2022 Wrangler NFR.<\/p>\n<p>The duo won its second round of the rodeo, capturing Round 7 with a 3.9-second time.

I\u2019ve ridden him at every NFR I\u2019ve been at, so he\u2019s pretty special.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>RELATED<\/strong>:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20231203085130\/https:\/\/www.sportdown.com\/news\/2022-wrangler-nfr-las-vegas-1st-go-round-results\/\">2022 Wrangler NFR Las Vegas 1st go-round results<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>RELATED<\/strong>:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20231203085130\/https:\/\/www.sportdown.com\/news\/2022-wrangler-nfr-round-2-results-highlights\/\">2022 Wrangler NFR Round 2 Results &amp; Highlights<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>RELATED<\/strong>:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20231203085130\/https:\/\/www.sportdown.com\/news\/2022-wrangler-nfr-las-vegas-3rd-go-round-highlights-results\/\">2022 Wrangler NFR Las Vegas 3rd go-round highlights &amp; results<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Tie-down roper Kincade Henry gets his second-round win<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Kincade Henry is making plenty of memories in his NFR debut.<\/p>\n<p>The Mount Pleasant, Texas, cowboy clocked a 7.1-second run to win Round 7.

So, to make that run, add another extra swing that builds confidence for these next three rounds, knowing I can go that far and still tie her in a short seven.

That\u2019s one thing I strive to help him with. He\u2019s smooth and easy so the less I can do, the better off we are,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe had a couple of slower rounds so I\u2019ve had to build up his confidence a little bit.
