He qualified for three Wrangler National Finals Rodeos (2016, 2017, and 2019) but has struggled to stay healthy.<\/p>\n<p>His most recent injury occurred in July of last year when we broke his right foot. The injury required surgery, and he effectively ended his season. The failure did not prevent him from returning to the bulls in 2022.<\/p>\n<p>Smith has been on a roll on the ProRodeo circuit for the past week. He won the bull riding title at the Guymon (Okla.) Pioneer Days Rodeo in two days, but also finished second at the Cactus Jack Xtreme Bull Riding in Uvalde, Texas.<\/p>\n<p>Those two days of work paid him $14,589, propelling him from 25th to 13th in the most current PRCA | RAM world ranking. He attributes his recent success to the animals he has had the opportunity to jump on board.<\/p>\n<p>He explained that drawing good bulls has been the source of much of Smith\u2019s success in recent weeks. I stayed optimistic and handled things one bull at a time. Everything worked out in the end.<\/p>\n<p>At Guymon, he won with a 91-point run in the Frontier Rodeo\u2019s Gladiator\u2019s Hammer. It was a rematch of last year when Smith was not so lucky.<\/p>\n<p>He commented that that bull felt great and that I was looking forward to the rematch. Last year in San Antonio, I slipped on him at the 7.8-second mark. So I knew he was happy, and I knew he was resisting. I was glad that he rode and won this time.<\/p>\n<p>Smith\u2019s goal for the summer race is to return to the Finals, but he realizes he has too much rodeo left. So he takes it one bull at a time.<\/p>\n<p>He added that you couldn\u2019t overthink anything; you have to follow one by one. It\u2019s too early to start looking at the rankings. Like I\u2019ve always said, the season doesn\u2019t change until.<\/p>\n<p>Read More Here:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20220520233830\/https:\/\/www.prorodeo.com\/news\/2022\/5\/11\/general-prca-standings-shuffle-garrett-smith-climbs-inside-top-15\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rodeo News &amp; Information<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Garrett Smith Climbs Inside Top 15: PRCA Standings Shuffle Garrett Smith has competed in the most critical stage of the rodeo.
