So they put on a big show for us, and we managed to tie up some great steers. It\u2019s also a friendly enough setup for ropers. I\u2019ve been then before, but indeed it\u2019s one I\u2019ve wanted to return to.<\/p>\n<p>The 2022 National Circuit Steer Roping Tests take place on Saturday and Sunday, and it starts at noon (MT) every day. Cowboys from Day 1 will compete in four rounds, and Sunday\u2019s challengers will race two more games. After completing all six rounds, the top eight cowboys will advance to an eight-man semifinal.<\/p>\n<p>The top four challengers from the semifinals will proceed to a four-person unforeseen death test. Patterson won the unexpected death trials last time with an alternate time of 10.0.<\/p>\n<p>I grew up playing every night with my dad, and having these road tests means it\u2019s essential for me to come and then see these guys, said Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon, a special guest at the homecoming event. From NCFSR. This is an important event for this state and this megacity. We are delighted to have this event.<\/p>\n<p>One of the businesses I have is steering rope, it\u2019s one of those alphabets (events) at the rodeo, and I\u2019ve always felt explosive that there\u2019s a heritage then, and we need to save that heritage. Cole Patterson will ride 17-year-old Tigger this weekend. Tigger is the two-time reigning Purina Horse of the Time.<\/p>\n<p>I just got him in shape and took him to his first rodeo last week since the (National Steer Roping Trials in November), Patterson said. I left it all downtime, so it\u2019s fresh and ready to go.<\/p>\n<p>Former world champion Rocky Patterson, Cole\u2019s father, is competing in the NCFSR again. Rocky is the only two-time NCFSR champion, winning in 2012 and 2019.<\/p>\n<p>Four-time world champion Scott Snedecor won $10,095 at the 2020 NCFSR and is ready for another race at Torrington. Snedecor rides 13-year-old Goose.<\/p>\n<p>I can\u2019t wait to get back then, said Snedecor. I enjoy the commission, and it is good to go out again. I like the qualifying rounds, where you get to do what you can for six games. Also, you get the unforeseen death deal, and that\u2019s delicious for the helmspersons; we don\u2019t get to do that very often.<\/p>\n<p>Steer roper Slade Wood, who finished sixth in the PRCA | RAM World Standings a while back; he\u2019s eager to see what he can do in the NCFSR. Wood will be riding Dynamo, 19. This shakes me, said Wood, 19. There are a lot of plutocrats and many steers on the rope, and I want to rope in this format. This should be fun.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>News: Cole Patterson ready to defend his NCFSR title in Torrington Cole Patterson has fond memories of the Steer Roping National Circuit Trials.
