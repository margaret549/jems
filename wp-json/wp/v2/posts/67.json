Munsell also tied with J.J. Hampton for the victory in round 10. It was the first time in 2022 that Hampton managed to do the victory lap, but the victory in the final third round went to the veteran roper from Stephenville, a resident of Texas. He also won round 10 in 2020 and 2021.<\/p>\n<p>Round seven saw Joey Williams break the 2.0-second mark. Williams, of Volborg, Montana, stopped the clock in 1.9 seconds for the win. Round eight was even faster as world-ranking leader Martha Angelone was victorious at 1.8. That added $5,080 to her impressive earnings and put her stamp on her 2022 world championship. It also earned her the National Cowgirl Hall of Fame\u2019s Betty Gayle Copper Fast Time Award. She finished the season with $130,303 and won her first world title.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is unbelievable,\u201d Angelone said. \u201cI left Virginia with nothing. When they started adding breaking ropes to professional rodeos, I set a goal to go to as many as I could, win as much as I could, and get a world title.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Cadee Williams of Weatherford, Texas won the event\u2019s championship by lassoing 10 calves in 31.9 seconds for the second most prestigious title in rodeo. Williams grew up in Montana as Cadee Tew, married a Texan, and now she and her family spend summers in Montana and compete in rodeos there.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe all knew that Martha was going to win it (the world title), so going for average was the next goal,\u201d Williams said. \u201cMy mare is only seven years old, so this was a real test. We do this as a family, so it\u2019s a win for the whole family.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The big-money winner at South Point Arena was Cheyanne Guillory, of Kingston, Oklahoma, who raised $27,037.<\/p>\n<p>The following are the results of the Wrangler Breakaway Roping National Finals, Tuesday, November 30, 2022.
