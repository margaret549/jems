He earned $209,405 at the 2022 NFR.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you break your record, it means you did better than the year before, whenever you set it,\u201d said Wright, 23. \u201cThe way I look at it is that I\u2019m improving every year, and to improve just from last year is pretty special and I\u2019m just happy with the way things are going.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Wright has now won four career all-around titles in 2019-22. Wright also won bull riding and saddle bronc riding world championships in 2020 and 2021, respectively.<\/p>\n<p>Wright is also on the brink of surpassing the bull riding and all-around single-season earnings marks.<\/p>\n<p>Wright has earned $451,850 in bull riding and $563,661 in all-around.

I\u2019m just worried about making 90-point rides.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tie-down roper Shad Mayfield matches arena record with a Round 6 victory<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Shad Mayfield, the 2020 PRCA World Champion Tie-Down Roper, was electric on Tuesday at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center.<\/p>\n<p>The Clovis, N.M., cowboy stopped the clock in 6.5 seconds tying the arena record. ProRodeo Hall of Famers \u2013 Cody Ohl (6.5 seconds, Round 10, 2003) and Trevor Brazile (6.5 seconds, Round 8, 2015) also accomplished the feat.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI feel so good, the energy of the fans after that,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s something I\u2019ve always dreamed of, throwing my hat like Cody Ohl used to, being 6.5 I mean that\u2019s just something I\u2019ve dreamed about.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That record run was something Mayfield was trying to digest.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t even explain it, I didn\u2019t even flank the calf all the way, I mean, if I had a better flank no telling what could have been,\u201d said Mayfield, 21. \u201cBut I feel like my horse made it so easy, and to have a good calf I just had to do my part. Once I heard them holler \u2018you\u2019re out\u2019 I just let my rope go. Tonight, I had to take it back to just like I\u2019m at home practicing or any jackpot.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Mayfield edged John Douch by a mere one-tenth of a second for the round win.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHonestly it just pumped me up hearing the crowd and doing all that,\u201d Mayfield said. \u201cI love that feeling of coming behind someone and being faster, and it\u2019s not easy beating someone at 6.6, so I got it done so that\u2019s what makes it even better.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Saddle bronc rider Logan Hay wins back-to-back rounds<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Logan Hay made it back-to-back victory laps.<\/p>\n<p>After winning Round 5, Hay made it two in a row capturing the Round 6 win with an 87.5-point ride on Frontier Rodeo\u2019s Yellowstone.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, it was our hoppers out again today and Yellowstone didn\u2019t go in Round 1, so I was happy to have one that was fresh,\u201d said Hay, 25. \u201cI knew it was a good draw and I just tried to do my job.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Hay, who is making his NFR debut, is the son of saddle bronc rider Rod Hay, a 20-time NFR qualifier, and older brother to fellow NFR saddle bronc rider Dawson.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been blessed that it\u2019s been working out,\u201d Logan said. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to take it one horse at a time and not let my nerves get the best of me. I\u2019ve just felt at home here. I think it\u2019s all the other Canadians and my dad here helping me in the chutes that made it feel this way. I love it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m looking to just stick to my game plan. Take it one horse at a time. I don\u2019t like to think about anything else. I\u2019ve hardly looked at the world standings, to be honest. I look at it as me versus my horse, get up to see what (score) I got, and watch a few videos. That\u2019s just what my game plan is.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bull rider Tristen Hutchings makes it three round wins at the 2022 NFR<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When cowboys make their NFR debuts they make memories for a lifetime.<\/p>\n<p>That has been the case for bull rider Tristen Hutchings.<\/p>\n<p>The Monteview, Idaho, the cowboy has won three of the first six rounds in his first career trip to the NFR.<\/p>\n<p>Hutchings\u2019 latest claim to glory came on Tuesday when he won Round 6 with an 88-point ride on Rocky Mountain Rodeo\u2019s Caddyshack. Hutchings also was tops in Round 1 and Round 5.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I had a really good bull tonight,\u201d Hutchings said. \u201cIt was a bull that I\u2019d been wanting to get on for a while now and he had me loosen up a little bit and took me for a ride. Finally, in the end, I got a good seat. It was good, it was fun, and there\u2019s no better place to win than here.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Hutchings thought he could take victory laps at the NFR based on his late-season surge.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAt the end of the season, I got on a heater, and I think it\u2019s carried into here,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t ever slow down getting on practice bulls or putting in the work at the gym. So, this is exactly what I\u2019ve thought about and dreamed about. It\u2019s life-changing money and there are a ton of nerves but at the end of the day, it\u2019s about having fun. That\u2019s when I think most bull riders are at their best.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou have to draw right to come in here and win three, especially in the first six nights. It\u2019s something you think is possible, but I was just hoping to come in here and ride as many bulls as possible. That\u2019s the only game plan I had in my head.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Rookie bareback rider Rocker Steiner captures Round 6 title<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This wasn\u2019t the script rookie Rocker Steiner had envisioned \u2013 until Tuesday.<\/p>\n<p>Steiner had an 88.5-point ride aboard Wayne Vold Rodeo\u2019s True Grit to win Round 6.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt is always great to get a win, especially at the NFR,\u201d said Steiner, 18. \u201cMy dad won here, and my mom won here, and it is great to win in the same place where your parents won.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Steiner, who placed in just one of the first five rounds, splitting fifth in Round 5, took a moment to describe his winning ride.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThat was a really fast, snappy, droppy (horse), it is not easy to ride,\u201d Steiner said. \u201cYou have to need speed to ride that horse. That horse bucked me off in Strathmore (Alberta) and it is just not an easy horse to ride.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Their emotions about Steiner have been well-documented at this year\u2019s NFR, but he is not about to change his ways.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think you all can tell I\u2019m competitive,\u201d Steiner said. \u201cI didn\u2019t come here for second place. I didn\u2019t come here to get a low score. I\u2019m not going for third or fourth. I\u2019m going to win. It is hard to hide my passion and my emotions. I just want to win.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go to South Point and get a buckle and hang out with my family. We are going to have a big crew on stage. There have been a lot of people with me my whole career and hopefully, I will get everybody on stage who has been part of it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Steiner, who bought his PRCA card on Jan. 10, is following the rodeo footsteps of his grandfather Bobby Steiner, who won a PRCA Bull Riding World Championship in 1973, and his father, Sid, the 2002 PRCA Steer Wrestling World Champion.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Steer wrestler Tristan Martin scores a Round 6 victory<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Steer wrestler Tristan Martin experienced the highs and lows of rodeo in 24 hours. The Sulphur, La., the cowboy had a no-time in Round 5 and then on Tuesday, he won Round 6 with a 3.5-second time.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey had missed him in the first round, but I had seen some videos on him, so I knew if I did my job, I had a good chance,\u201d Martin said.<\/p>\n<p>Martin\u2019s run came after a 15-minute delay because of a power outage in the Thomas &amp; Mack Center, which caused him to reel things in.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I was pretty amped up before the power went out, so I think it was just what I needed to help me calm back down and make a good run,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p><strong>RELATED<\/strong>:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20231003183403\/https:\/\/www.sportdown.com\/news\/2022-wrangler-nfr-las-vegas-1st-go-round-results\/\">2022 Wrangler NFR Las Vegas 1st go-round results<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>RELATED<\/strong>:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20231003183403\/https:\/\/www.sportdown.com\/news\/2022-wrangler-nfr-round-2-results-highlights\/\">2022 Wrangler NFR Round 2 Results &amp; Highlights<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Team ropers Chad Masters\/Joseph Harrison claim the Round 6 crown<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Team ropers Chad Masters\/Joseph Harrison had not had much luck at the 2022 Wrangler NFR.
